## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a gentle sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke feelings of peace and hope, reflecting the organization's commitment to children.
- Background color: Off-white (#F9F6F2), a slightly warmer alternative to pure white, ensures readability and visual comfort. It also harmonizes well with softer pastel tones.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FFA500) adds a touch of vibrancy and symbolizes joy. It should be used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and highlights.
- Body text: Use 'Inter' sans-serif font for body text, offering a modern and clean appearance with excellent readability on all devices.
- Headline text: Employ 'Alegreya' serif font for headlines. Its flowing, calligraphic style makes it extremely legible. The small details give it rhythm and make it more pleasing to read for long stretches of text.
- Employ clear, minimalist icons to enhance usability. Icons should use the orange accent color (#FFA500) sparingly, to draw attention to important UI elements.
- The layout should be clean, with generous white space to create a sense of calm and focus. Utilize a grid system for a structured and responsive design.
